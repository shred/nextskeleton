# The Next Skeleton

This is a skeleton generator for quickly starting an assembler project for the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum Next](https://www.specnext.com/) computer.

It is targeted for Linux systems, but might also work on MacOS and Windows with some modifications.

## Requirements

Make sure the following packages are installed on your system. There should be precompiled packages available in your package manager.

* [`ant`](https://ant.apache.org/)
* `curl`
* `mono`
* `mtools`
* `python3`

The following third-party tools need to be installed too. There are probably no precompiled packages for them, so they must be installed manually.

* [sjasmplus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus) for assembling the Z80N sources. Build it with `make`, then copy the `sjasmplus` binary somewhere in your `PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

* [#CSpect](http://dailly.blogspot.com/) is the ZX Spectrum Next emulator. It comes as a precompiled .net binary that can be run with `mono`. Just unpack the latest version somewhere in your system (e.g. in your home directory or in `/opt/cspect`).

Now add a small bash script called `cspect` that is located in your `PATH` and looks something like this:

```
#!/bin/bash
mono /path/to/your/cspect/CSpect.exe "$@"
```

If you type `cspect` in a command line, a window with a ZX Spectrum 48K emulation should appear.

Of course, you should also have a copy of the Next Skeleton somewhere on your harddisk.

Everything is installed? Let's have a [quick start](start.md)!

## Why is it called "Skeleton"?

Spooky, isn't it?

But it's a [common term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(computer_programming)) of computer programming. A _skeleton_ is just the bare minimum that is necessary for running something, maybe accompanied by some pseudocodes or simple examples that are meant to be changed or removed.

As a software developer, it is now your task to "add flesh" to the skeleton, and make it a real project.

This skeleton has everything that is necessary for assembling, running, debugging, and releasing a ZX Spectrum Next program. You won't have to figure it all out by yourself, but you can immediately start with the fun part of your project: programming it.
